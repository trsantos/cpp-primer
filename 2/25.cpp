// int* ip, i, &r = i;
// ip is a pointer to an int. i is an actual int object. r is a reference to the int object i.

// int i, *ip = 0;
// Again, i is an int object. And ip is a pointer to an int that had been initialized to 0.

// int* ip, ip2;
// ip is a pointer to an int and ip2 is an int object, despite its name.
